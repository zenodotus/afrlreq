# African Language Enablement

Though this group and repository experts explore gaps & requirements for the support of African-origin languages on the Web and in eBooks. 

It aims to address the problem that experts don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their language on the Web, and the W3C doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise. This network of experts should help to significantly reduce that problem. 

Some experts will hopefully go a step further, and contribute to a gap-analysis or requirements document for a given script.

Topics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis template](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html). This work feeds into the [language matrix](http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which provides a heat-map for language issues on the Web.  You can find a list of open issues, including those from W3C Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=afrlreq) page. (That link applies an `afrlreq` filter.)

Note that existing groups are already working on support for languages written with the [Arabic](https://github.com/w3c/alreq) and [Ethiopic](https://github.com/w3c/elreq) scripts.  That work will not be duplicated here.

### Documents
- TBD


### Feedback
Please use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/afrlreq/issues) to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents. (Learn [how GitHub issues work](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/issues.html).)

Note that the public-i18n-africa mailing list is used to send notification digests & meeting minutes. It is **not** for technical discussion.


### Participate
You can participate in the task force work at various levels. In order of increasing commitment, these include Follower, Contributor, Participant, Editor, and Chair. [Find your level](https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/wiki/Layout-task-force-roles).

That list is notified (no more than once a day, and in digest form), about changes to issues in this repository, but also about other W3C Working Group issues related to the African writing systems.
